# Project Background and Context

In this capstone project, our goal is to predict the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage. SpaceX promotes its Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, priced at 62 million dollars, while other providers charge over 165 million dollars per launch. A significant part of the cost savings comes from SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage. Thus, if we can ascertain whether the first stage will land successfully, we can estimate the overall launch cost. This analysis could be valuable for any competing company interested in bidding against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
